  ```javascript
  // 1. Created a function using the method arr.some() to check if the letter is a vowel.
  // The method .some() will return either true or false.

  // 2. We have another function to remove the vowels.
  // 2.1 First we split the text and using arr.map() and or previously function we return only an array without the vowels.

  // 3. At the end we use join to have a string.
  ```

  ```javascript
  // 1. In this solution we also have 2 functions. The first one validated if is or not a vowel.
  // 2. The second function push into the array result all not vowels.
  // 3. At the end we use join to have a string.
